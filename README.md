# BetterEndRod-
XP flows out of end rods😋Makes it seem more realistic.
You can custom the amount of xp and interval it flows out.
It's nice for slow pace servers and go afk.
Here are a few configs that I recommend for you:
Noob😋:
exp-interval-ticks: 20
exp-amount: 5
radius: 16
Pro😨:
exp-interval-ticks: 5
exp-amount: 5
radius: 32
Hacker🕶️:
exp-interval-ticks: 1
exp-amount: 20
radius: 64
Gade👑:
exp-interval-ticks: 1
exp-amount: 50000
radius: 128
